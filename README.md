### Hello there 😃

My name is Anderson Sprenger, I study 💻 Computer Science and work with 🍎 iOS Development.

I ❤ technology, as well the _⭐possibilities⭐_ that it brings.

I'm very interested into `🔍 research` to create new solutions, and also in `📱 mobile development` to make it _applied_ in our 🌞 lifes.

As hobby, I ❤ gaming, anime, manga & light lovels.
