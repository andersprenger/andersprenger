### Hello there 😃

My name is Anderson Sprenger, I study 💻 Computer Science and work with 🍎 iOS Development.

I ❤ `computers and technology`, as well the _⭐possibilities⭐_ that it brings.

I'm very interested into `🔍 research` to create new solutions, and also in `📱 mobile development` to make it present in our 🌞 lifes.

As hobby, I ❤ gamming, anime, manga & light lovels.
